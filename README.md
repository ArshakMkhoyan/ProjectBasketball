# Description
The essence of this project lies in generating the probability of victory of a home/away team in a basketball match based on historical data that contains approximately 14 thousand games with observations for end-of-periods' results and winning teams by then. The probabilities are derived using an empirical method of computation, and can be accessed - with enough room for user's customization - via the application with interactive dashboard in ShinyApp.
